    Database Configuration:
        The code defines the DB_URL, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD constants to hold the database connection information (URL, username, and password).

    Main Method:
        The main method is the entry point of the program.
        It establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the JDBC driver and runs the createEmployeeTable and performOperations methods.
        The performOperations method provides a menu-driven interface for users to choose different operations on the employee table.

    createEmployeeTable Method:
        This method creates the "employee" table in the database if it does not exist already.
        The table has three columns: "id" (auto-incremented primary key), "name" (VARCHAR), and "salary" (DECIMAL).

    performOperations Method:
        This method provides a menu-driven interface to perform various operations on the "employee" table based on user input.
        It calls different methods depending on the user's choice.

    Various Operation Methods:
        deleteRecordById, selectAllRecords, updateRecordsById, updateRecordsByName, updateRecordsBySalary, deleteRecordsWithSalary, sortRecordsByAttribute, sortRecordsBySalaryDes, addEmployeeRecord, and selectRecordById are methods that handle specific operations on the "employee" table.
        They use SQL queries with PreparedStatement to interact with the database.
        Each method performs a specific action such as deleting records by ID, updating records, displaying records, or adding new records.

    Menu-Driven Interface:
        The performOperations method uses a do-while loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit (entering 9).
        The user's choice is read using Scanner and determines which operation to perform.

    Exception Handling:
        The code includes try-catch blocks to handle SQLExceptions that might occur during database operations.

Overall, the code provides a simple console-based Employee Management System that allows users to interact with the MySQL database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the "employee" table. Users can select, update, delete, and add employee records using the menu-driven interface provided by the program. The program uses JDBC to connect to the MySQL database, and the different methods handle specific database operations using SQL queries
